No Index Lookups, Scale Free, No Schema [9] Graph Databases Book - http://graphdatabases.com/ Neo4J True Graph Database that does not limit the number to triples like Triplestore. Neo4j stores data in nodes connected by directed, typed relationships with properties on both, also known as a Property Graph. NEO4J is opensource and contains lot of tool interfaces to program in due to the community http://www.neo4j.org/learn/neo4j Neo4J - Hype or Real; Dump Now, Connect Later. Multiple Node Clusters. Billions of Nodes (90% of Cases). Nodes and Relationships have Properties. REST Api Interface with tools in all programming languages. Natural language Processing Style Query language. Topple the stacks of records in a Relational Database while keeping all the relationships, and you'll see a graph. Where an RDBMS is optimized for aggregated data, Neo4j is optimized for highly connected data. A Key-Value model is great for lookups of simple or even complex values. When the values are themselves interconnected, you've got a graph. Neo4j lets you traverse quickly among all the connected values The container hierarchy of a Document Database accommodates nice, schema-free data that can easily be represented as a tree. Which is of course a graph. Refer to other documents (or document elements) within that tree and you have a more expressive representation of the same data that you can easily navigate with Neo4j.[10] [10] Neo4J Data Models - http://www.neo4j.org/learn/nosql **Markov Chain in Neo4j - http://nicolemargaretwhite.blogspot.com/2013/10/markov-chains-in-neo4j.html Cypher v/s SQL Joins in Sql and Cypher SELECT bar.* FROM foo JOIN bar ON foo.id = bar.foo_id WHERE foo.id = 101 START foo=node(101) MATCH foo-->bar RETURN bar SELECT bar.*, foo_bar.* FROM foo JOIN foo_bar ON foo.id = foo_bar.foo_id JOIN bar ON foo_bar.bar_id = bar.id WHERE foo.id = 1 START foo=node(1) MATCH foo-[foo_bar]->bar RETURN bar, foo_bar [11] http://systay.github.io/blog/2011/11/06/cypher---a-view-from-a-recovering-sql-dba/ [12] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6873772/sql-postgres-shortest-path-in-graph-recursion/6900257#6900257 yfiyfit Cypher v/s SPARQL Sparql is designed for data models with Namespace Identifiers and each property are treated as nodes.

Backend application with ElasticSearch for searching \"entities\" Backend application with Graph Database (Neo4j) for mapping the \"relationship\" Data analytics platform for performing analysis on the datastore of Biograph. Backend Application is a REST API endpoints and the Frontend Applicaiton will be an Angular Framework. Problem - Data Integration Entities in the application meaning - \"gene\", \"protein\", \"chemical\", \"pathway\" and \"diseases\". The problem with most of the biological databases, is the lack of quality or quantity of these entities. The Biograph application plans to solve this by integrating these databases. In the Data integration, the inclusion and exclusion of the entities will result in quality of the final datastore. Solution - ElasticSearch ElasticSearch is a database that can be used to unify the entities and further streamline our process in eliminating the duplication of entities. The ElasticSearch is important for curation purposes. ElasticSearch will increase the rate at which the curation is done and also eliminate duplication in relationships. The backend could be further used for text-analysis and automatic curation in the future. Schema - ElasticSearch {\"index\": {\"_index\": \"ctdbio\", \"_type\": \"string\"}} ## [\"chemical\",\"gene\",\"protein\",\"pathway\",\"disease\"] { \"bid\": bid, ## Primary Unique Number that will represent the type \"type\": \"string\", ## [\"chemical\",\"gene\",\"protein\",\"pathway\",\"disease\"] \"name\": name, \"primary\": {dictionary}, \"secondary\": synonymns, ## List of Synonymns \"tag\": [list], ## Tag for the entity \"text\": \"string\" ## Text that is relevant to the Entity } Schema - Chemical sc_line = { \"bid\": bid, \"type\": \"chemical\", \"name\": name, \"primary\": {\"drugbank\": drugbank, \"cas\": cas}, \"secondary\": synonymns, \"tag\": [], \"text\": chemtext } Schema - Gene sc_line = { \"bid\": bid, \"type\": \"gene\", \"name\": name, \"primary\": {\"biogrid\": biogrid, \"pharmagkb\": pharmagkb, \"uniprotid\": uniprotid, \"gene_symbol\": gen_sym, \"alt_gene_ids\": alt_gene}, \"secondary\": synonymns, \"tag\": [], \"text\": \"\" } Schema - Disease sc_line = { \"bid\": bid, \"type\": \"disease\", \"name\": name, \"primary\": {\"alt_dis\": alt_dis, \"medic_terms\": medic}, \"secondary\": synonymns, \"tag\": [], \"text\": distext } Schema - Pathway sc_line = { \"bid\": bid, \"type\": \"pathway\", \"name\": name, \"primary\": {}, \"secondary\": [], \"tag\": [], \"text\": \"\" } Problem - Graph Datastore Entities in the graph datastore are the same - \"gene\", \"protein\", \"chemical\", \"pathway\" and \"diseases\". The biological databases just try to map a single relationship between entities. The Biograph application plans to solve this by able to map relation across different entities with path information. In building the datastore, the quality of the database will depend on the expressiveness of the queries and the usefulness of the query to the biologists. Solution - Neo4j Neo4j is a database that will be used to store the data in a network format or graph format. The Neo4j will be important as it can do some of the data analytic's like node degree and path identification easy for the application. Neo4j will help in storing the relationship created by the curators. Schema - Ne04j { \"table\":{ \"_response\":{ \"columns\":[ \"r\" ], \"data\":[ { \"row\":[ { \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03F (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27777\" } ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ { \"id\":\"155926\", \"labels\":[ \"gene\" ], \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03F (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27777\" } } ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ { \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03R (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27778\" } ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ { \"id\":\"155927\", \"labels\":[ \"gene\" ], \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03R (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27778\" } } ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ { \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03.MMHAP34FRA.seq\", \"bid\":\"53288\" } ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ { \"id\":\"155928\", \"labels\":[ \"gene\" ], \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03.MMHAP34FRA.seq\", \"bid\":\"53288\" } } ], \"relationships\":[ ] } } ], \"stats\":{ \"contains_updates\":false, \"nodes_created\":0, \"nodes_deleted\":0, \"properties_set\":0, \"relationships_created\":0, \"relationship_deleted\":0, \"labels_added\":0, \"labels_removed\":0, \"indexes_added\":0, \"indexes_removed\":0, \"constraints_added\":0, \"constraints_removed\":0 } }, \"nodes\":[ { \"id\":\"155926\", \"labels\":[ \"gene\" ], \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03F (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27777\" } }, { \"id\":\"155927\", \"labels\":[ \"gene\" ], \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03R (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27778\" } }, { \"id\":\"155928\", \"labels\":[ \"gene\" ], \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03.MMHAP34FRA.seq\", \"bid\":\"53288\" } } ], \"other\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ], \"size\":3, \"stats\":{ \"contains_updates\":false, \"nodes_created\":0, \"nodes_deleted\":0, \"properties_set\":0, \"relationships_created\":0, \"relationship_deleted\":0, \"labels_added\":0, \"labels_removed\":0, \"indexes_added\":0, \"indexes_removed\":0, \"constraints_added\":0, \"constraints_removed\":0 } }, \"graph\":{ \"nodeMap\":{ \"155926\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03F (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27777\" }, \"155927\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03B03R (Research Genetics)\", \"bid\":\"27778\" }, \"155928\":{ \"name\":\"DNA segment, 03.MMHAP34FRA.seq\", \"bid\":\"53288\" } }, \"relationshipMap\":{ } } } Schema - labels { \"table\":{ \"_response\":{ \"columns\":[ \"labels(n)\", \"type(r)\" ], \"data\":[ { \"row\":[ [ \"disease\" ], \"chemical_disease\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"gene\" ], \"chemical_gene\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"pathway\" ], \"chemical_pathway\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"chemical\" ], \"chemical_gene\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"disease\" ], \"gene_disease\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"pathway\" ], \"gene_pathway\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"chemical\" ], \"chemical_disease\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"pathway\" ], \"disease_pathway\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"gene\" ], \"gene_disease\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"chemical\" ], \"chemical_pathway\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"disease\" ], \"disease_pathway\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } }, { \"row\":[ [ \"gene\" ], \"gene_pathway\" ], \"graph\":{ \"nodes\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ] } } ], \"stats\":{ \"contains_updates\":false, \"nodes_created\":0, \"nodes_deleted\":0, \"properties_set\":0, \"relationships_created\":0, \"relationship_deleted\":0, \"labels_added\":0, \"labels_removed\":0, \"indexes_added\":0, \"indexes_removed\":0, \"constraints_added\":0, \"constraints_removed\":0 } }, \"nodes\":[ ], \"other\":[ ], \"relationships\":[ ], \"size\":12, \"stats\":{ \"contains_updates\":false, \"nodes_created\":0, \"nodes_deleted\":0, \"properties_set\":0, \"relationships_created\":0, \"relationship_deleted\":0, \"labels_added\":0, \"labels_removed\":0, \"indexes_added\":0, \"indexes_removed\":0, \"constraints_added\":0, \"constraints_removed\":0 } }, \"graph\":{ \"nodeMap\":{ }, \"relationshipMap\":{ } } } Challenges Data Integration - need database parsing in the format the schema entails. Graph Datastore - the quality of the relation and the scoring the relationship edges. Frontend - the intuitiveness of the interface will enable the curators to contribute towards building the database. Quality evaluation - Quality parameters for the curators. Thank you..
